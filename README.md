# planner
An Android app for a minimalistic planner. It is adapted for a Unihertz Jelly Star 2 so it needs some adaptation for a bigger phone. For data sync you can use the [planner-server](https://github.com/maubrunn/planner-server) and for easier data maintenance the [planner-web](https://github.com/maubrunn/planner-web).
